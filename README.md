# Homebrew for Linux ARM

> [!CAUTION] **This Fork**
> Since this is an unsupported hack, this may eventually break.

> [!NOTE] **How to use**
>
> All this fork does is _hack_ to allow ruby installed by rbenv to be used instead of `/usr/bin/ruby`:
> [GitHub commit - Allow ruby from rbenv to take precedence](https://github.com/sergeycherepanov/linuxbrew-arm/commit/18f7e3d5a54078201430fade8ab76fadd9b282ea):
>
> ```bash
> # filter the user environment
> PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
> PATH="${HOME}/.rbenv/shims:${PATH}"
>
> #FILTERED_ENV=()
> FILTERED_ENV=("RBENV_VERSION=${RBENV_VERSION-}")
> ```
>
>
> To install this Homebrew, you'll first have to install `rbenv` (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04's version from `apt` is ok):
>
> ```shell
> git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build  # apt's ruby-build is too out of date
> rbenv install 3.1.4
> rbenv shell 3.1.4
> export HOMEBREW_BREW_GIT_REMOTE=https://github.com/sergeycherepanov/linuxbrew-arm
> export HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=1
> /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh | sed '532s/abort/warn/')"
> ```
>
> You'll also need to add the core tap back (nowadays deprecated):
>
> ```shell
> brew tap homebrew/core
> ```
>
> After installation, to run `brew` you should probably create a `brew` wrapper that contains:
>
> ```bash
> #!/bin/bash
> [[ -d ~/.rbenv/bin ]] && export PATH="~/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
> if command -v rbenv &>/dev/null; then
>   export PATH="${PATH//$(rbenv root)\/shims:/}"
>   eval "$(rbenv init -)"
>   rbenv shell 3.1.4
> else
>   echo "Warning: rbenv not found" >&2
> fi
> HOMEBREW_BREW_GIT_REMOTE=https://github.com/sergeycherepanov/linuxbrew-arm HOMEBREW_DEVELOPER=1 exec /home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew "$@"
> ```

> [!IMPORTANT] **Partial solution**
> Of course, this is only half the battle. Many official formulas won't work because they weren't
> written with Linux ARM in mind. (For example, as of 2023-08-26, installing python, which the rust
> formula requires, will fail.)

> [!WARNING] I'll try to regularly rebase my changes on top of the latest upstream commits, and then
> I'll force push the new rebased commits. So you might need to `reset --hard` after fetching
> updates for this repo

## What Packages Are Available?

1. Type `brew formulae` for a list.
2. Or visit [formulae.brew.sh](https://formulae.brew.sh) to browse packages online.

## More Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [our documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/).

## Contributing

We'd love you to contribute to Homebrew. First, please read our [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Homebrew/.github/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#code-of-conduct).

We explicitly welcome contributions from people who have never contributed to open-source before: we were all beginners once! We can help build on a partially working pull request with the aim of getting it merged. We are also actively seeking to diversify our contributors and especially welcome contributions from women from all backgrounds and people of colour.

A good starting point for contributing is to first [tap `homebrew/core`](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#can-i-edit-formulae-myself), then run `brew audit --strict` with some of the packages you use (e.g. `brew audit --strict wget` if you use `wget`) and read through the warnings. Try to fix them until `brew audit --strict` shows no results and [submit a pull request](https://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request). If no formulae you use have warnings you can run `brew audit --strict` without arguments to have it run on all packages and pick one.

Alternatively, for something more substantial, check out one of the issues labelled `help wanted` in [Homebrew/brew](https://github.com/homebrew/brew/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [Homebrew/homebrew-core](https://github.com/homebrew/homebrew-core/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

Good luck!
